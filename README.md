# UFOs

## Overview
Purpose of the module 11 challenge was to create a webpage that included a dynamic table that provided an in-depth analysis of UFO sightings through the ability to filter the table using multiple criteria.

## Results
To utilize the webpage you will want to enter your search criteria in the various input boxes provided in the filter search section on the left-hand side of the web page. Upon entering the criteria, you need to hit tab, enter or click in the next filter to update the data based on the parameters of your choosing. You will want to ensure that when entering your parameters that the formatting lines up with the placeholder text you see currently see in the input boxes (see image 1). If you incorrectly capitalize or misspell a word the table will not return a result as shown in image 2 below.

## Summary
One draw back of the new design was removing the 'Filter Table' button. I believe this allowed the individuals a way to clearly identify and know they were in fact filtering the table once all criteria was entered. 

To further improve the functionality of the webpage I would recommend creating a button that would clear the filters, this will eliminate the need for users to delete the text entered in each individual input box. Another feature that I would recommend would be to add the ability to sort the table. This will increase the users ability to analyze and group the data.
